# OpenShift Update Graph Viewer

This repository is based on the work made by @ctron in https://github.com/ctron/openshift-update-graph.

On top of his work, this repository adds a proxy to get OpenShift update channels from GitHub and adds the posibility to get the update graph directly from a public/self-managed Cincinnati instance.
